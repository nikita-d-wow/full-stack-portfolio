#Merge: 
--Merges two branches together, preserving the history of both
--Creates an extra merge commit.

>>It keeps the exact history of what all things happened.
>>Easier to see when and where branches diverged.

>>History can become messy when many merge commits.

#Rebase:
--Takes the commits from one branch and reapplies them on top of another branch. 
-- Rewrites branch history.

>>Cleaner and liner history 
>>Easy to use.

>>It rewrites the commit history and its harmful if the branch is shared.
>>it requires force-push
